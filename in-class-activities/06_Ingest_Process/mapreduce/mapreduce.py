What's the most used word in 5-star customer reviews on Amazon?

We can answer this question using the mrjob package to investigate customer
reviews available as a part of (a small sample of) Amazon's customer reviews dataset.

In order to run the code below, be sure to `pip install mrjob` if you have not
done so already.
