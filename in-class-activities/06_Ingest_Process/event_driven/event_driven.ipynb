This data is being collected and sent into the cloud on up to a second-by-second basis (note, though, that the data stream is bursty; no information is sent from the sensor if the decibels are below a certain threshold) and needs to be processed and entered into a database as quickly as possible for further analysis downstream (e.g. identifying locations that are overly noisy for a duration that is deemed unacceptable).\n",
