    "# Working with Large Data Sources in S3\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to be working with a large public dataset that is hosted in S3: the [NYC Taxi dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/) (copied to our `css-uchicago` public bucket for your use in this class). We could theoretically download this data and work with it locally, but it is enormous and it is not practical to query and subset it on a local machine. It makes sense to work with the data in the AWS cloud, where it already lives. To this end, we will use Python's `boto3` library to run AWS Athena SQL queries on the data. With these resources, we can begin to access and understand these large datasets in a serverless capacity, without needing to set up standalone database servers. We'll explore formal large-scale database solutions in our next class and further methods for analyzing and fitting models on large-scale data in Weeks 7 and 8 when we learn more about Spark and Dask, but this should whet your appetite and help you see how you can use `boto3` to do large-scale cloud computing tasks within a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, please install the `boto3` package (this can be achieved by running `pip install boto3`). The package will allow you to work with AWS resources using the credentials you have provided as a part of your AWS CLI configuration. So, you should confirm that these credentials are correct (recall that your AWS Academy session token changes every 4 hours) in order to ensure the code runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There also seems to be an error for recent `boto3` installations in instantiating the S3 client. This can fixed by downgrading the package s3transfer via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

First of all, we could assess the general content of a file by previewing a file. For instance, we could generate a url for a file in S3 and read only a subset of the file's rows into a Pandas DataFrame. You'll notice, though, that this takes a while to run.

    "## AWS Athena\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be much faster and more effective to use [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) synthesize and subset our data in the cloud before sending data back to our local machine. Athena is a serverless approach for querying data in S3 -- it effectively spins up compute cores for us, runs queries for us in parallel, and then returns the results of the search to S3 for further analysis (limiting the amount of data we are moving from our local machine to cloud and from the cloud to our local machine). Athena additionally allows you to run SQL queries over all of the available files in the bucket being queried (for instance, over all of the Yellow Cab CSV files in the NYC Taxi Bucket), so can be particularly effective for exploratory analyses of large public datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only catch with Athena is that, before you can run any queries, you will need to specify your data schema -- how your data is structured and the data types that are used -- so that it knows how to read the data. After you have specified this information, Athena can run standard SQL queries in a serverless fashion (if you need a SQL refresher, take a look at the [SQL courses on DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql) for a quick look at the basics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's establish our data's schema using the `create_db` and `create_table` SQL queries (using `boto3` to run our queries using Athena):"
